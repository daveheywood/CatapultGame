This is the code from the SitePoint tutorial for creating the "Catapult Wars" game for Windows 8, using Javascript and VS2012.

This is my first run at a Win8 game, and thought I may as well use the new GitHub for Windows with this project too, so aplolgies if the repository/config etc is all a little mess...

At the time of writing, I havn't completed the tutorial, but do aim to finish this, make multiple commits during this and then tweak the app to have a play with the canvas/ease items, although I don't want'need to do game development, this is a good stating point before I port a couple of other projects to a Win8 Metro app....
